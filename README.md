# 🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

### This project analyzes the Zomato restaurant dataset (9,551 records, 21+ features) to uncover insights about cuisines, cities, restaurant performance, and customer preferences.

### The analysis covers:

#### ⚬ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

#### ⚬ Business insights with SQL queries

#### ⚬ Predictive modeling (classification & clustering)

#### ⚬ Interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization

## 🗂️ Files in Repository

### ⚬ Zomato Data Analysis.ipynb → Python notebook with full data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, ML models.

### ⚬ Zomato_Project.sql → SQL queries for business insights and decision-making.

### ⚬ Zomato Dashboard.pbix → Power BI interactive dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### ⚬ Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

### ⚬ SQL: PostgreSQL queries for business insights

### ⚬ Power BI: Dashboard for KPIs & visual storytelling

## 🔑 Key Steps

### Data Preprocessing

#### ⚬ Removed duplicates & nulls

#### ⚬ Converted data types and handled outliers

### Feature engineering:

#### ⚬ main_cuisine

#### ⚬ cuisine_count

#### ⚬ price_per_person

#### ⚬ Flags for online delivery, table booking, delivering now

#### ⚬ rating_category (excellent, good, average)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

### ⚬ Top 10 cuisines & cities

### ⚬ Cost distribution by table booking

### ⚬ Online delivery vs ratings

### ⚬ Correlation heatmap (votes, cost, rating)

### ⚬ High-value restaurant analysis

## Machine Learning

### ⚬ Logistic Regression → Predict high-rated restaurants (Accuracy: 87%)

### ⚬ KMeans Clustering → Segmented restaurants into 3 customer/restaurant clusters

## SQL Insights

### Some key queries included:

#### ⚬ 📊 Top 10 cuisines & cities

#### ⚬ 💰 Price bucket analysis (Low/Medium/High)

#### ⚬ 🚨 High-price but low-rating restaurants (risk for churn)

#### ⚬ ⭐ Percentage of high-rated restaurants per city

#### ⚬ 🛵 Online delivery vs ratings

#### ⚬ 🪑 Table booking vs cost

#### ⚬ 🌍 Best & worst cities for Zomato expansion

## Power BI Dashboard

### Interactive dashboard highlights:

#### ⚬ 📍 Top cuisines and cities

#### ⚬ ⭐ Ratings distribution

#### ⚬ 💵 Cost analysis

#### ⚬ 📊 Votes & performance metrics

#### ⚬ 🚀 Strategic recommendations for expansion

## 📈 Key Insights

#### ⚬ North Indian & Chinese dominate cuisines in India.

#### ⚬ New Delhi, Gurgaon, and Noida host the majority of restaurants.

#### ⚬ Restaurants offering table booking generally have higher average costs.

#### ⚬ Online delivery doesn’t always guarantee higher ratings.

#### ⚬ High votes do not always equal good ratings → quality gaps exist.

#### ⚬ Logistic Regression achieved 87% accuracy in predicting restaurant quality.

#### ⚬ Clustering identified 3 distinct restaurant segments (premium, mid-range, budget).

## 🚀 Business Recommendations

#### ⚬ Focus expansion in cities with both volume and high average ratings (e.g., Delhi NCR, Gurgaon).

#### ⚬ Improve service in low-rating but high-vote restaurants to prevent churn.

#### ⚬ Target marketing for popular cuisines (North Indian, Chinese, Fast Food).

#### ⚬ Encourage table booking in high-cost restaurants for better experience.

#### ⚬ Explore online delivery improvements to enhance quality perception.
